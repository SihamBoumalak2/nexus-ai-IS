query_agent.py

This module defines the QueryUnderstandingAgent class. It acts as the language interpreter
for student messages in the attendance system. It uses GPT to:
- Understand the type of question a student is asking.
- Detect which class they are referring to.
- Fetch attendance summaries from the database.
- Generate helpful natural language responses.

This agent helps coordinate responses across the entire multi-agent system.
