// ðŸ“˜ Purpose:
// This JavaScript file runs a simple script when the "About" page loads.
// It is useful for debugging or confirming that the pageâ€™s scripts are working properly.

// âœ… Wait for the entire page (DOM) to be fully loaded
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    
    // âœ… Log a message to the browser console
    // This message confirms the script is working and the page has fully loaded.
    console.log("About page loaded successfully!");
