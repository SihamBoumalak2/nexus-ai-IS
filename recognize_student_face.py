recognize_student_face.py
Facial Recognition Utility for Student Identification

Purpose:
This script powers the facial recognition component of an AI-driven 
attendance system. It uses a webcam to detect student faces, compares 
them to a database of stored face encodings, and marks attendance in 
real-time. It also enables WebSocket-based communication with a frontend
dashboard for live updates.

üîß Key Features:
- Captures and analyzes video frames using OpenCV and face_recognition.
- Matches detected faces against pre-encoded data from a database.
- Marks recognized students as "Present" and logs attendance.
- Emits live updates to a frontend interface via SocketIO.
- Supports end-of-session cleanup by marking absent students.

    Real-Time Face Recognition for Classroom Attendance

    This function activates the webcam and continuously captures video frames.
    Each frame is analyzed for faces using `face_recognition`, and matched against
    preloaded encodings to recognize students.

    Once students are recognized, their attendance is:
    - Sent live to the frontend via WebSocket (using SocketIO)
    - Recorded in the SQLite database
    - Tracked during the session to avoid duplicate entries

    Parameters:
    - app: Flask app instance used for context handling.
    - socketio: Flask-SocketIO instance for real-time communication.
    - class_id: ID of the current class session (used to tag attendance).
    - professor_id: ID of the professor (used for record tracking).

    The function runs until either:
    - The 'q' key is pressed
    - A global stop flag is triggered (`stop_flag = True`)

    Requirements:
    - The global `known_face_encodings` and `known_face_enrollments` must be loaded before calling this.
    - The global `cam` and `SESSION_RECOGNIZED_STUDENTS` are used and managed here.
